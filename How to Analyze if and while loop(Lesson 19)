WHILE LOOP
x = 1;                           
while(x < y)
{
statement;
x = x *2;
}


EXPLANATION 

x
____________
1
1*2=2
2*2=2^2
2^2 * 2= 2^3

2^a
NB: Note that it will terminate when x >= y
x = 2^a
You can then say:
2^a >= y
2^a = y
a = log2(y)  That's log y base 2

Therefore, time complexity is O(logn)
