for(a = n; a >= 1; a = a/2)
{
statement;

}

Explanation
a starts from n
a
_______________
n
n/2
n/2^2
n/2^3

n/2^y time 
 (NB, we don't know how many times so we use 2^y to represent the number of time)

Assume a has become less than one, a < 1,
Therefore, n/2^y < 1
>>>> n/2^y = 1
>>>> n = 2^y
>>>> y = log2(n)( log n base 2)
The time complexity is O(log2(n))
