Algorithm Test(n)
{
if(n<8)
{
cout << n << endl;--------  1
}
else
{
for(i = 0; i < n; i++)
{
cout<< i << endl; ------- n
}
}
}
If the condition is true, then it will execute just one statement so the time is O(1)
If the condition is false, meaning when its greater than 5, then it's going to repeat for n times so the time is O(n).
Therefore,
O(1) is the best case time
O(n) is the worst case time
