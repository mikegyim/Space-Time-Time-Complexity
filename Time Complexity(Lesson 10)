for(c=1; c<n; c=c*2)
{
statement;
}

Explanation 
c     
1
1*2 = 2
2*2 = 2²
2² * 2 = 2³

 2^y ( We don't know how many times this will go on. So lets say it will go on for 2^y  time) 

Assume c became greater than or equal to n ------------- c >=n
And since c = 2^y
2^y >= n
So if 2^y = n
Then y = log n base 2  ----------- log2n
Therefore time complexity will be O(log2n)
